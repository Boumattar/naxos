Welcome to _Naxos Solver_, a library for an object-oriented
Constraint Programming environment implemented in C++. It
supports the statement of Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(CSPs) having constrained variables with finite domains
containing integers. Please read the
[__manual__](manual/README.md) in order to use it
[[BibTeX](manual/naxos.bib)].

_Amorgos_, a search methods library written by Foivos
Theocharis, is also included in the `plugins` directory.
